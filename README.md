# React Search Visualizer

This search visualizer provides the ability to see how various search methods perform when traversing a maze.

Currently, two official search methods are available:

- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search

## How to use

Adjust the speed of the visualizer prior to initiating a run. To initiate a run:

- Click either the BFS or DFS button if no run has been initiated
- Click New Maze if a run has been initiated and/or concluded and then click either BFS or DFS
